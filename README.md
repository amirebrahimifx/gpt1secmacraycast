# gpt1secmacraycast
It's tool that allows you to ask quick questions from chat gpt small window with having your screenshot and copied text already in the chat bar. For using this tool you need Raycast application installed. 



a summarization of whole process(made by AI) you need to do after you have installed Raycast. 


Here’s a clean, step-by-step guide you can drop into your GitHub README for the Raycast version. No code repeated—just what people need to do.

Install & Set Up
	1.	Prereqs

	•	macOS (Ventura/Sonoma/Sequoia), Raycast installed.
	•	ChatGPT for macOS installed with Quick Ask enabled (⌥Space by default). If you use a different hotkey, change it to Option–Space in ChatGPT settings so the script can toggle Mini.

	2.	Create the scripts folder

	•	Open Terminal → run:

mkdir -p ~/.raycast/scripts



	3.	Create the script file

	•	Open the file in a terminal editor:

nano ~/.raycast/scripts/quick-ask-text-image.sh


	•	Paste the provided script (starts with #!/bin/zsh and ends with the clipboard clear).

	4.	Save & exit

	•	In nano: Ctrl+O → Enter (save), then Ctrl+X (exit).

	5.	Make it executable

	•	Back in Terminal:

chmod +x ~/.raycast/scripts/quick-ask-text-image.sh



	6.	Add to Raycast

	•	Raycast → Settings → Extensions → Script Commands.
	•	Click Add Directories… → choose ~/.raycast/scripts.
	•	You should see Quick Ask: Text + Image appear (💭 icon).

	7.	Assign a hotkey

	•	In Raycast, open the script’s … menu → Set Hotkey (choose something global, e.g. ⌃⌥⌘K).

First-Run Permissions (one-time)

You’ll grant these to Raycast (the runner):
	•	Screen Recording: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Screen Recording → enable Raycast.
	•	Accessibility: System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable Raycast.
	•	Automation: The first run may prompt “Raycast would like to control System Events / ChatGPT.” Click Allow for each.

If you don’t see prompts, run the script once; macOS shows them on demand.

How to Use
	1.	Put the window you want help with frontmost.
	2.	Hit your Raycast hotkey.
	3.	The tool will:
	•	Capture the topmost real window (no shadow). If macOS can’t capture it, you’ll be asked to click a window or drag a region—so you never hit a dead end.
	•	Open ChatGPT Quick Ask (Mini) on your current Space and focus the input.
	•	Paste the image first, then your clipboard excerpt (if any) + helper text.
	•	Clear the clipboard after a few seconds (so you don’t keep a giant PNG).

⸻

What it does (in plain terms)
	•	Grabs the frontmost window via window-ID capture (robust across displays/Spaces/scaling).
	•	Falls back to interactive capture if needed (no error popups).
	•	Uses the text already on your clipboard as an “excerpt,” trims long text, and appends a short instruction.
	•	Pastes image then text into Quick Ask. (This order works best across apps.)
	•	Optionally you can enable auto-send inside the script (keystroke Return). If you do, Raycast will need Accessibility (already covered above).

⸻

Troubleshooting
	•	Nothing gets pasted: give ChatGPT a moment—open Raycast → Preferences → Advanced and ensure Raycast has Accessibility; also try increasing the internal “Wait” from 0.35–0.5s (inside the script).
	•	Prompt asks another app to control the Mac: that means you’re not using the Raycast script; you’re probably triggering a macOS Quick Action/Service. Use the Raycast hotkey for this tool to avoid front-app prompts.
	•	“Could not create image from window/rect”: the script already handles this by falling back to click-a-window or drag-a-region. If you still see it, verify Screen Recording is enabled for Raycast.
	•	Mini doesn’t open: ensure ChatGPT → Settings → Quick Ask uses ⌥Space. The tool sends that toggle.

⸻

Uninstall / Update
	•	Remove or edit the file at ~/.raycast/scripts/quick-ask-text-image.sh.
	•	Raycast refreshes Script Commands automatically; you can also click Reload in the Script Commands settings.

⸻

Pro tips
	•	Turn off macOS Screenshot’s Floating Thumbnail to make clipboard images appear instantly (Screenshot app → Options).
	•	Multi-monitor friendly: window-ID capture ignores coordinates, so you don’t need per-display math.
	•	Privacy-aware: the tool keeps everything local; it only pastes into ChatGPT because you invoked it.
	•	If you iterate often, keep your changes in this single script—Raycast hotkey stays the same, no new permissions needed.

That’s it—copy these steps into your README and folks can get from zero to ✨ working hotkey in a minute.
