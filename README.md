A lightweight tool that lets you ask ChatGPT quick questions from a small window—anywhere on your Mac. It’s designed to let you provide maximum context in your prompt effortlessly.

Setup Instructions

	1.	Create a Shortcut in Apple Shortcuts.
 
	2.	Add these two actions to the shortcut:
 
	•	Take Screenshot → This captures the context.
 
	•	Run AppleScript → Paste the provided code on Shell File provided in this repo.
 
	3.	In the shortcut’s Info/Details panel, assign a keyboard shortcut for instant access.

Now, whenever you hit your chosen hotkey, you can quickly capture your screen and send the context to ChatGPT in seconds.

You need to give it some permissions and I found it to work without that much permission and errors with using raycast. If you run it on raycast it works all the time.
